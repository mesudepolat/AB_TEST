# AB_TEST

Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type, “average bidding”, as an alternative to its existing bidding type, called “maximum bidding”. One of our clients, bombabomba.com, has decided to test this new feature and wants to conduct an A/B test to understand if average bidding brings more conversions than maximum bidding.

In this A/B test, bombabomba.com randomly splits its audience into two equally sized groups, e.g. the test and the control group. A Facebook ad campaign with “maximum bidding” is served to “control group” and another campaign with “average bidding” is served to the “test group”.


## How would we define the hypothesis of this A/B test?
* H0 : There is no statistically significant difference between the Control group that was served “maximum bidding” campaign and Test group that was served “average bidding” campaign.

* H1 : There is statistically significant difference between the Control group that was served “maximum bidding” campaign and Test group that was served “average bidding” campaign.
