# AB_TEST

Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type, “average bidding”, as an alternative to its existing bidding type, called “maximum bidding”. One of our clients, bombabomba.com, has decided to test this new feature and wants to conduct an A/B test to understand if average bidding brings more conversions than maximum bidding.
